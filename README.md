## Incentives for Health Care Provision (Working Title)

This GitHub repository contains data and documented R code for ["Incentives for Health Care Provision"](), authored by [Danilo Freire](http://danilofreire.github.io) and [Umberto Mignozzetti](http://umbertomig.com). 

> **Objectives.** To quantify the impact of financial incentives on the productivity of health personnel combating *Aedes aegypti* and on city-level numbers of dengue hospitalisations. <br>
> **Methods.** We hired and trained subjects to visit households, find *A. aegypti* breeding sites, and kill mosquito larvae in the city of Rio Verde, Brazil, in May 2018. We provided individual and team bonuses to two treatment groups, while the control group received a flat compensation for completing their tasks. <br>
> **Results.** Financial bonuses increased the number of cleaned breeding sites in both treatment groups (individual and team bonuses) and the collective treatment also improved larvae extermination. The intervention lowered dengue hospitalisations in 10.3%, but the result is not consistent across all model specifications. <br>
> **Conclusions.** Performance bonuses improve the performance of health personnel, yet more research is needed to assess whether higher worker productivity decreases dengue hospitalisations. <br>
> **Public Health Implications.** *A. aegypti* control programmes may benefit from alternative compensation schemes, specially when provided to teams. For this strategy to succeed, financial incentives have to be distributed widely as their aggregate effect is limited. <br>
>
> **Keywords**: Aedes aegypti, dengue, financial incentives, mosquito control, preventive health care, randomised field experiment, worker productivity

## TO DO

* Explicar porque temos 2 tabelas diferentes na parte de _Disease Incidence_, e em qual sentido elas são distintas. A seção _Results_ ainda me parece ter um pouco de imprecisão.

* Colocar os intervalos de confiança nas estimações citadas no texto.

* Checar o _n_ dos participantes em cada grupo.

* Revisar a nova versão do apêndice. A que está no repositório não contém o modelo formal e está incompleta.
